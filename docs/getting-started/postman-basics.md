# 🧪 How to Use Postman (Without Feeling Lost)

## What is Postman?

Postman is a tool that helps you **send and receive data** from web systems (also called APIs) — without writing code. It’s like talking to a system directly through a friendly interface.

---

## Why Use It?

- Test how an API works  
- Send data to a server  
- See what a response looks like  
- Learn how systems “talk” to each other

---

## 🚦 Let’s Try It: Your First Request

### Step 1: Install Postman
Go to [postman.com/downloads](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) and install it for your OS.

### Step 2: Open Postman
Launch the app. You’ll see a tab with a big orange **"New"** button. Don’t worry—we’re keeping it simple!

### Step 3: Make a Request

Try this:
- Select `GET` from the dropdown
- Enter this URL:  
  `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random`
- Click **Send**

🎉 You’ll get a JSON response with a random dog image!
