If you’ve worked near developers, you’ve probably heard about “sprints,” “standups,” and “retros.” Here’s what they really mean.

## 🧩 What’s a Sprint?

A **sprint** is a short cycle (usually 1–2 weeks) where the team focuses on building or fixing specific things.

## 🗓 Typical Sprint Events

- **Sprint Planning** – Team agrees on what to work on  
- **Daily Standup** – Quick check-ins on progress  
- **Sprint Review** – Show what was built  
- **Retro** – Talk about what went well or didn’t  

> Developers use this process to stay focused and deliver value consistently.
